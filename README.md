# AirBnB_Seattle_Listings_2016

1.	Libraries Used
Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, and Matplotlib

2.	The Motivation for the Project
I evaluated AirBnB Seattle property listings from 2016 for a project pertaining to Data science, Analysis, and Python.

3.	The files in the repository
I included a python file containing the project. I did not include other files yet due to the 25MB file size limitation.

4.	A summary of the results of the analysis
Using the data, I needed to answer the following questions:

1. What months of the year have the highest average listing prices?
2. Which neighborhoods have the highest rating review scores?
3. Which neighborhoods have the highest listing prices?
4. What attributes in the listing data most associate or contribute to prices?

I used a k-means model to answer the last question.

5.	Necessary acknowledgements.
